hello talk about vcs the place where store source code for software and open source

## 2 ##
penser pendant tout la pr√©sentation que construire un logiciel c'est comme construire un batiment
## 3 ##
bob le codeur fou, he codes on his laptop. He writes textual line in text editor
## 4 ##
The result of bob's job is a file with text. This text has a meaning. He is readable by human and any developper is capable to understand the goald of the programme
## 5 ##
Now it's time to give the text (source code) at the compiler, the compiler eat a text file and give a file with only 0 1 it's the binary we talk about binary file
## 6 ##
The result is a binary file, it's unreadable for human, only the machine can understand the file. each 01 make sens for computer. We talk about instructions. You can exec the binary in your laptop? when you run firefox it's a binary for example

## 7 ##
Ok it's complicated ! I know but image with a building
we need a plan to design the building, the plan is very important if we want an update of building

## 8 ##
the result is the building finish. 

## 9 ##
It's the same thing we a doc file which serve you to generate a pdf. 
if you loose the pdf you can regenerate him with doc, but if you loose doc you cannot modify pdf
## 10 ##
I think you begin to imagine where I want to come. In the worst case you building or your software burn ....
The only way to rebuild everything is to build from source code or from the plan of building
## 11 ##
I want to tell you a true story.
In my company, We had have a software which have a bug appaers, Normal, But the responsible team of the soft have lost the source code ..., We had cannot modify the software. A big mess ! 
## 12 ##
This man is my god. It's Linus Torwald, He make linux, and he make git. The most famous VCS. becasue it's the most powerfull, fastest,  
## 13 ##
The main goal of the VCS is to store the source code! keep it secure !
## 14 ##
We can manage the history of the software. When we talk version of software, that mean the software was build with a specific source code
## 15 ##
Previously I said we have to keep it secure our source code. The best way it's to push your source code in the cloud. And the most famous website is github. And github has a speciality, every source code is public.
## 16 ##
And when the source code is public, we can talk of open source. Every one can look the source code of the application
## 17 ##
I love this slide. I put it on all my presentation. Just appreciate.
## 18 ##
So you understand, a software open source have many advantage, and I feel the most important is the software is modifyable? You are not prisonner you have no handcuff. If the soft is bad you can fork it and build a better.
## 19 ##
And now the dance of freedom !
When we talk about privacy and our data, opensource could help us to have a better control of our data
## 20 ##
Some question maybe ?
